After you have prepared your source database and connection information, you can set up your new pipeline.

1. In the [Redis Cloud console](https://cloud.redis.io/), go to your target database and select the **Data Pipeline** tab.
1. Select **Start pipeline setup**. 
1. Enter a **Pipeline name**. This pipeline name will be the prefix to all keys generated by this pipeline in the target database.
1. Enter the **Deployment CIDR** for your pipeline, or use the one that is generated for you. This CIDR should not conflict with your apps or other databases.
1. In the **Connectivity** section, enter your **PrivateLink service name**.
1. Enter the ARN of your [database credentials secret](#share-source-database-credentials) in the **Source database secrets ARN** field.
1. Select **Start pipeline setup**.

At this point, Redis Cloud will attempt to create your new pipeline. 

Pipelines are created in the background. While they're creating, you aren't allowed to make changes. This process will take some time.

See [Troubleshoot pipeline]() to view a list of errors that can occur at this point.

When your pipeline is created, select **Complete setup**.
